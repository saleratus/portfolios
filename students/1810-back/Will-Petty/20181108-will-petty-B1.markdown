# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I set out to learn the rudiments of Ruby in this module; and as an older student, I really wanted to get out of my mental ruts and restore some brain plasticity. I think I was successful on both counts.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I did not struggle with the material per se, but as an older student, I struggled with the need to do a lot of things that seemed not to apply to me or my future at all. I also struggled with the need to work on projects with others who were far below my level.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite was Battleship. In that project I had a pretty passive partner who left me free to do what I wanted with the interface and artificial intelligence aspects of the project. I approached these fairly independently and enjoyed implementing a graphical, color solution for the display, and an artificial intelligence solution that turned the entire board into a complex grid of probabilities.

My least favorite project was Black Thursday. That project was dominated by partners who were well below my level of capability. Though I was a willing teacher, there was very little joy in that project, and I felt I was just waiting most of the time, giving my partners room to do some work on their own and turn the project into an experience that would be beneficial for them.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned that, even though I'm older than others in the class, I can excel here without any problem at all. I actually feel pretty relaxed about my experience at Turing so far.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned that the capabilities of your project partners are extremely important - that sometimes you have to switch to being more of a teacher than a programmer.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I was in the choir, and helped out in my class by being an enthusiastic student who was as helpful as I could be to others who needed guidance.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I feel the most important thing I can do is to help my fellow classmates succeed, and would like to continue doing that in the next module.
